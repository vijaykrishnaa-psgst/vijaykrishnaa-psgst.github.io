            Write an Angular template which contains an <mark>"enter your name"</mark> form. As you type, it updates

            Let's build one now. There are two input fields, each with a number,
            Use the curly brace syntax or <code>ng-bind</code> to output the sum of the two numbers.
            When you fill in the fields, output a little list in HTML.

            We are going to allow people to type in a profile picture url and have that picture appear
            immediately. Create a field and bind it to a model called something like <mark>"avatarUrl"</mark>.
            Now use the avatarUrl as the <code>src</code> attribute of an <code>img</code> tag.

            Add in a checkbox. Bind it using <code>ng-model</code>. When the checkbox is checked, the edit fields are
            visible. When is not checked, the edit fields are hidden. Use <code>ng-show</code> to make this work.

            1. Create a <code>profileController</code>. Use <code>ng-controller</code> to add it to your profile form.

            now available in your front end. <br>

            Instead of having the profile widgets next to each other, nest them inside one another. Have a

            Modify your controller so that all of the <code>$scope</code> attributes which make the form work are nested
            inside a JSON object called profile.

            Extend your profile form with a <code>$scope.person.name</code> field. Let's make name mandatory. use
            <code>$scope.$watch</code> to watch the <code>'person.name'</code> property of scope.
            If the value is not blank, set <code>$scope.errors = false</code>.
            Otherwise set <code>$scope.errors = {name: "should not be blank."}</code>.
            Now in your template, use <code>ng-show</code> to show a nice warning message if
            <code>errors != false</code>.

            First go here and grab the <code>ng-dialog.js</code>. Link it in the header of your document in the usual
            way with a <code>script</code> tag.
            Now download the CSS files: <code>ng-dialog.css</code> and <code>ng-dialog-theme-plain.css</code>.
            Link them using <code>link</code> tags. <br>

            Now use <code>ng-repeat</code> to loop over the array and output it to the <b>DOM</b> . Add sort and search
