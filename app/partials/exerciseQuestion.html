            creation to greet you by name.
            Write an Angular template which contains an "enter your name" form. As you type, it updates

            As an evil genius, you need a calculator to help you work how many helidrones you will need to
            steal the houses of parliament.
            Let's build one now. There are two input fields, each with a number,
            Use the curly brace syntax or ng-bind to output the sum of the two numbers.
            When you fill in the fields, output a little list in HTML.

            You are an entrepreneur, creating the next LinkedIn. Users of your awesome service have said
            that they would like to be able to choose a profile picture just by entering a URL.
            We are going to allow people to type in a profile picture url and have that picture appear
            immediately. Create a field and bind it to a model called something like "avatarUrl".
            Now use the avatarUrl as the src attribute of an img tag.

            an h2 somewhere on the page.
            Add in a description textarea. This will update the a paragraph of description text under the

            We are going to hide the edit fields when they are not needed so that we either see the edit form
            or the profile.
            Add in a checkbox. Bind it using ng-model. When the checkbox is checked, the edit fields are
            visible. When is is not checked, the edit fields are hidden. Use ng-show to make this work.

            We are going to add a profileController to your super advanced profile form from the previous
            exercise. <br>
            1. Create a profileController. Use ng-controller to add it to your profile form. <br>
            2. In your controller, set a default name, description and profile picture URL

            Extend the calculator exercise. We are going to create a function to allow us to zero all the
            values. <br>
            1. Create a function in your controller which zeros number1 and number2. Add it to $scope. It is
            now available in your front end. <br>
            2. Add a button to your DOM and use ng-click to call the function.

            Extend the profile exercise from the previous section. We should be able to have multiple profile
            widgets on the same page. Copy and paste a few out. Type in one. Notice how they are separate
            units of interaction, each with its own controller and $scope.

            Instead of having the profile widgets next to each other, nest them inside one another. Have a
            play and see how they interact. This might be surprising for the user.
            Modify your controller so that all of the $scope attributes which make the form work are nested
            inside a JSON object called profile.
